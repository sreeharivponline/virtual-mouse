# Virtual Mouse with Eye Tracking using MediaPipe

This project implements a **virtual mouse** that allows users to control their computer cursor using **hand gestures and eye tracking**, powered by **MediaPipe** and **OpenCV**. It eliminates the need for a physical mouse by detecting hand movements and eye blinks to perform common cursor actions.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Hand Tracking**: Move the cursor using hand gestures.
- **Eye Tracking**: Control cursor actions using eye movements.
- **Gesture Recognition**: Click, scroll, and drag using specific gestures.
- **MediaPipe Integration**: Utilizes Google's **MediaPipe Hands** and **Face Mesh**.
- **Customizable Sensitivity**: Adjust detection parameters for better accuracy.
